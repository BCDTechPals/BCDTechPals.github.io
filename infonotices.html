    <ol>
      <li style="float: none !important; color: white"> Find new tech articles, specifically tech related to seniors, apps popular for seniors, PSA
        for senior online safety, and funny tech/seniors with tech memes/ all tech humor. Ideally,
        our Tech Pals facebook group would like 2 new posts a week. </li>
        
        <li style="float: none !important; color: white"> Research. We will provide students with a login for grant search websites. Students can
        find grants and fill in details on a grant questionnaire including, grant due date,
        requirements, description, who, what, where, when, how. </li>
        
        <li style="float: none !important; color: white"> Help to write grants. Students will be given copies of past Grant entries and are free to
        repeat the material but must also mention current activities. </li>
        
        <li style="float: none !important; color: white"> We will provide students with email addresses and lanyards and business cards both the
        type to hand out to new potential volunteers, as well as the type to hand out to new
        potential clients. Students can help with outreach and calling retirement centers to set
        up presentations for the residents. Students will be given a wrap for this. </li>
        
        <li style="float: none !important; color: white"> We would love to host students' bio and photos on our website. This is great for
        students' transcripts and recognition on the internet. We have photo releases. </li>
        
        <li style="float: none !important; color: white"> Students can also help out with photography. If we are able to do things in person, we
        would love to have someone take some photos of students helping seniors and happy
        seniors using their technology. </li>
        
        <li style="float: none !important; color: white"> Learn SEO and help our business and website gain more traction. Read and site
        sources and create a simple, easy to follow, way to SEO. </li>
        
        <li style="float: none !important; color: white"> Reach out to local news and to the Denver Post, Megan Weber, with updates and try to
        get us on the news. Also, daily spotlight on non profits doing good in our community.
        NPR, KGNU, CPR, also iHeart radio. Search all non profit advertising agencies.

        <li> Make a video with many students, explaining how we help seniors embrace technology
        and enrich their lives. We will then if able to do in person work, continue with video
        testimonials from seniors. Students can get involved with the filming. Also recording
        presentations for YouTube. </li>
